In this project you'll build a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout should demonstrate an understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

You will write CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using media queries, you’ll add breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
